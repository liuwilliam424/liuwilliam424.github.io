            <p>So I’ve heard of this movie before, which means that I thought it would be good. And you know what? It was good. But also, it’s probably entirely overrated. I just looked at <a href = "https://letterboxd.com/jack/list/official-top-250-films-with-the-most-fans/">this list.</a> (At the time of writing this, the words 'this list' don't properly show that it's a link, but if you click on those words it should still properly lead to the right site.) And it really doesn’t seem to deserve that number 6 spot. Though, to be fair, I don’t agree with the order of the movies there either.</p>
            
            <p>My takeaway is that you should try to live in the moment and enjoy life. Because you’re going to forget things anyways. And also, the ending had a very Arrival-esque feel to it, where they know the relationship will end in disaster, but are going to pursue it anyways.</p>
