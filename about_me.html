        <h3>A Little Bit About Myself</h3>

        <article>
            <p>Awhlo.</p>

            <p>My name's William Liu, and I'm from an alright suburban town in New Jersey. My parents immigrated from
                China in the 90s in hopes of a better future. I was born in 2005, grew up with a little brother three
                years my junior, and was fortunate enough to live a privileged, middle-class childhood. I'm a student at
                UIUC studying Computer Science and Linguistics.</p>

            <p>But that's just a bird's-eye viewpoint of my life. I enjoy video games, reading, and ice skating. My
                favorite color is red. My music tastes trend towards 2010s pop but also include a significant amount of
                broadway music. My most used emoji is ðŸ˜©.</p>

            <p>There's a good chance that most of you reading this already know all of this and probably more. I'm not
                really advertising this website to anyone other than people who already know me pretty well, so this
                page might be unnecessary. But I think the idea of having an About Me page is pretty cool.</p>

            <p>If I were to tell you who I really am, I'd talk about things I'm ashamed of. Things like League of
                Legends or Harry Potter fanfiction. Or maybe I'd talk about my kinkiest fetishes or something. But
                that's too weird and too vulnerable for me to talk about on the first page most people will see (other
                than the cover page with the drawing of my face).</p>

            <p>I probably change too rapidly for a slowly-updated about-me page to cover who I am. But I hope you got a glimpse of who I am.</p>
