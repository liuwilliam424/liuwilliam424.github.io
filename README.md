# Welcome

This is a personal website â€” not a professional one. I don't plan on sharing this in any career context, and I think it's mostly people already in my life that will read anything here. Though, I'll be pleasantly surprised if someone I don't know reads this.

Also, I'm unsure how you even navigated to this page. Perhaps you're looking at the GitHub repository hosting this website or just added README.md to the url.

Anyways, I'll also put a `TODO` here.

## TODO

- pop-ups on right a la the MIT blogs
- custom 404 page
- get rid of vertical scrolling on mobile page
- archival system for what's new page
