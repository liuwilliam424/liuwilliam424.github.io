        <article>
            <p>My current passion project is this personal website, which has been occupying most of my free time recently. When I'm not there I'm usually interning at AT&T Labs. The hours are 11-7 every weekday, which is mildly terrible, but I'll manage.</p>
            <p>In other news, I'll be going to college in like a month, which is a little crazy. Can you believe it? We're college kids now. We've blasted through teenagehood and now we're baby adults. I hope I'm ready for this.</p>
